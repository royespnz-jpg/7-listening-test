# Listening Exam — 7th Grade

Colegio Nocturno de Cariari · Second Semester 2026 · Teacher: Saiden Ortiz Gómez · 9 points (10%) · One lesson

Same design and behaviour as the 10th and 11th grade exams: each audio can be played **up to 3 times**, the exam
is graded automatically, and every result goes to a Google Sheet.

| Part | Audio | What students do | Points |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Multiple Choice | `audio1.mp3` | 3 questions about the place the speaker visited, options A–C | 3 |
| Matching | `audio2.mp3` | For Niagara Falls, the Amazon Rainforest and the Grand Canyon, choose the sentence (1, 2, 3) that says why the speaker found it wonderful | 3 |
| Identification | `audio3.mp3` | Under the flashlight, the pillows and the sleeping bag, choose who was asked to bring it: Rose, Harry or Grace | 3 |

In Matching and Identification each number or name can be used only once, as on the printed exam.

## The answer key is not here

The repository is public, so the answers are **only in the teacher's Google Apps Script**. The page sends the
student's answers; the script grades them and writes one row per student:

`Fecha y hora · Nombre del estudiante · Grupo · Puntaje · Porcentaje · Nota (10%) · Multiple Choice · Matching ·
Identification · Correctas · Incorrectas · Detalle por pregunta · ID`

## Setup

1. **Google Sheet**: create a new sheet → `Extensions ▸ Apps Script` → paste the script → run `configurar` once →
   `Deploy ▸ New deployment ▸ Web app` (*Execute as: Me*, *Who has access: Anyone*) → copy the `/exec` URL.
2. **The page**: put that URL in `script.js`:

   ```js
   const APPS_SCRIPT_URL = "https://script.google.com/macros/s/..../exec";
   ```

3. **GitHub Pages**: `Settings ▸ Pages ▸ Deploy from a branch ▸ main ▸ /(root)`. The exam is then at
   <https://royespnz-jpg.github.io/7-listening-test/>.

## Files

| File | What it is |
